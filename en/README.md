# For each module

**Card 1 categories (mandatory)**

Categories allow you to filter content in Explore. The categories are shown at the top in a horizontal scroll bar, which allows the user to browse by category and choose the one they want to see.

When the user selects a category, the content is shown in a vertical format (as opposed to having to scroll horizontally), so that the user doesn't miss any content.

In Explore CMS, select the category or categories that apply to the card that you are configuring:

- **Accessories**: earphones, cases, watches.
- **Bundles**: packs, plans, product packs.
- **Devices**: smartphones, tablets.
- **Loyalty**: membership, loyalty/retention programmes content (Vivo Valoriza, Priority, Club Movistar, etc.)
- **Promos**: promotional content that may apply and which may coexist with other categories.
- **Plans**: rates, plan upgrades.
- **Services**: added value services, apps, new app features, other TEF services.
- **TV**: television plans, content packs, featured or new content.

{% hint style="info" %} The category **All**, which is the first one that you see, isn't a category as such. Rather, it is the way in which the user can view all the content.

By default, when a user opens Explore he/she sees all content and all configured cards. As such, the selected category is always **All**. {% endhint %}

ðŸŽ¯ **Good practices**: We don't recommend assigning more than one category to a content. Explore CMS does not set a limit for the number of categories that can be assigned.

#### What should I consider when using the categories?

Consult the **Categories** section of the FAQ to resolve all of your doubts.
