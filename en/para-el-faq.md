## Categories

In this section, you can resolve all of your doubts regarding the configuration of categories, learning how to configure them in the optimum manner:

### Does all the Explore CMS content need to be categorised?

Yes, that's right. All the content needs to be assigned to at least one category.

### Can I edit, create or delete a category in Explore CMS?

No, it's not possible to create, rename or delete any of the existing categories from Explore CMS. But don't worry, because the categories that you can select have been agreed with your OB, meaning you won't need to create new categories.

If you still feel that there is content that doesn't apply to any of the available categories, please feel free to contact your OB manager for him/her to forward your request to the NOVUM team. They will make a joint decision as to whether or not a change is necessary.

### I've seen that there are many pre-defined categories in Explore CMS, but I don't need all of them.

Don't worry. If there's a category that you don't need, don't use it. In this case, the category won't be shown to the user.

### Can I use one category for all my content?

No, you need to use at least 3 of the proposed categories. This feature doesn't make any sense if you use just 1 or 2 categories, as the filtered content will be the same as the unfiltered content.

Anyway, you're bound to have some really interesting content that applies to at least 3 categories, which is the minimum amount for this feature to make any sense. In fact, we recommend using between 3 and 5 categories. This will considerably improve the user's experience of Explore CMS.

### Can I change the order in which the categories are shown in Explore?

From Explore CMS, no. But don't worry, because the order will already have been agreed with the managers of your OB prior to the launch of the categories.

If you feel like a change is necessary, please inform the person responsible for your OB so that they can manage the change with NOVUM staff.
